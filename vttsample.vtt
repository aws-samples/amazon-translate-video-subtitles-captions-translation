Hello. My name is John Doe. Welcome to

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.890
the blog demonstrating the ability to

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.320
translate from one language to another

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.580
using Amazon Translate. Amazon Translate is a neural machine translation service that delivers fast, high-quality,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.880
and affordable language translation. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.280
Neural machine translation is a form of language translation automation 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.280
that uses deep learning models to deliver more accurate and natural-sounding translation than traditional statistical and rule-based translation algorithms.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.510
The translation service is trained on a wide variety of content across different use cases and domains to perform well on many kinds of content.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.870
Its asynchronous batch processing capability enables you to translate a large collection of text or HTML documents with a single API call.
